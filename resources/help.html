    <h1 class="title"> Upload a custom font</h1>
    <div class="text">
        In order to use a personal font it is necessary to upload its web version.
        A web-font is a translation of the font that can be interpreted by browsers and is what allow you to
        visualize writings using a style chosen by the author. Web-font consists of the two following files:
        <ol>
            <li>
                A css that defines the font name and source using the @font-face directive. This file is
                necessary and sufficient for a correct upload if the source is available online.
            </li>

            <li>
                In cases where the source is not available online, the upload system notifies the need to upload
                this too, that is a .woff or .woff2 file which contains information on how to display
                the font. <br>
                The difference between the two formats is related to their compatibility with browsers, woff for older ones and
                woff2 for newer versions, as shown <a target=_blank  href="https://transfonter.org/formats"> here </a>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        You can easily generate all the necessary files using a generic web-font generation site,
        such as one of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a target=_blank  href="https://transfonter.org/">www.transfonter.org</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a target=_blank  href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator">
                    www.fontsquirrel.com </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        The upload screen, reached through the button <img alt="icona di upload" id="fakeIcon"
                                                                       src="img/iconupload.png">
        on the homepage, display notification of any faults or errors in the files, giving the possibility to rename the font
        if a conflict occurs with one already present in our archive. <br>
        The management of uploaded files takes place entirely on Client side: custom fonts remain available
        until the browser page is closed.

    <h1 class="title"> Contrast Check </h1>
<p class="text">
    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines defines a method for calculating contrast using the luminance of a
    color. Contrast is calculated between two colors, usually between the background color and the color of the text,
    in order to evaluate and quantify the accessibility of reading a Web page. <br>
    The contrast ratio goes from a minimum of 1: 1, when the two colors are the same, at 21: 1, when you have white with
    black. <br>
    Again according to the standard issued by WCAG 2.0, a large text is defined if the font size is greater or equal to
    24px; or if it is greater than or equal to 18px and is in bold (at least 700 points in thickness), otherwise you
    have a normal text. <br>
    Depending on the ratio obtained we have:
</p>
<ol class="elenco" type="I">
    <li class="listitem"> If the contrast ratio (CR) is greater than 4.5 then you have AA certification for plain text.
        <br></li>
    <li class="listitem"> If the CR is greater than 3 and the text is large you get the AA certification. <br></li>
    <li class="listitem"> If the CR is greater than 7 and the text is normal, the certificate is AAA. <br></li>
    <li class="listitem"> If the CR is greater than 4.5 and the text is large, it is AAA certified. <br></li>
</ol>
